The hardest part to understand is part three, there are few problems with it:

1. The documentation did a very poor job of explaing whats actually going on. Its simply too short. For example, there seems to be a gap between instruction and what code is asking for us. There is no way to understand we need to iterate for every number smaller than hops from just pdf.

2. Its far from complete, many of the trick and basics are on piazza. I agree with putting hint on piazza, but that should be only 30% most. With this project, I feel at least 60% of the useful information thats necessary is on piazza. Ideally it should be lower thus allow student to finished it without external help.

3. Testing for the whole project is off. The chinese server is way too inconsistent, I understand that this is to create a "real life" experience, but unable to use school wifi is just too much and may even be unfair to someone. I have to finish the whole thing in cafe strata since both my school and home wifi cant be used. It get very cold there very fast there.
